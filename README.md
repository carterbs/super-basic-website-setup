## Super basic website setup
This is a simple project designed to get a novice web developer up and running in little to no time. There's no build process and no javascript framework. Just HTML and javascript. The index page does use bootstrap, which is just a collection of css for looks and jquery-based for basic functionality. It's very useful for making websites quickly. 

## Getting Started

Make sure you have installed Node; npm will come with node.

Open a terminal (VS Code has one. Hit `ctrl + ~` to open it).

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run dev`
3. Open a browser, and point it to `http://localhost:3000/index.html`.
4. Go play with it.
