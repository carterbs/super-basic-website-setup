	<!-- "/" refers to the "root" of the server. In this case, it's the main folder that index.html lives in (because that's where we started our server). On a real server, it'd be the folder that your DNS points your website to...
	DNS is a complicated and difficult topic. Just know that when you tyoe "google.com" into your browser,
	that request is routed to a server. The server then points you to a folder and an html file inside of that folder. The "root" of your website is set up when you publish
	a website. When running our example locally, it's the main folder in this repo. -->
	<a href="/pages/secondLevel/page3.html">Root Relative Link to page 3 (has different css file path examples)</a>
	<!-- "./"" means "starting at the directory that this file is in." For linking.html, that's the "pages" directory. -->
	<a href="./secondLevel/page3.html">Relative link to page 3</a>
	<!-- An absolute link is just that - there's no guesswork. The link points to a web address without figuring out where the current file lives or any of that.
	They're good for linking to external resources or websites. For your own resources, best practice is to use relative links. -->
